- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vladlgv. Just finished collage, wanna become a good programmer, still don't know if that is a realistic goal but I'll let everyone know if it is when I get there.

- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Golang, Python, Scanning, data analytics, penetration testing, Blockchain, Data Science, Good books, maybe copy pasting code from good repos.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Golang** and **Python**.

- 💻 I want to inmprove my penetration testing skills and I already have some skills with **HTML**, **CSS**, **C#**, **Java**, **React**, **Angular**, **SQL**, **PSQL**, **Terraform** some
understanding of **C**, **C++**, **javascript** * in the sense that I worked with it. 

- ☁️ I also know how to use **AWS** and **Azure** not idea how **Google cloud** works but would like to take a gander in the 
coming future. I hate PHP but I know how to use that too. (J.K. I don't hate it I just think there are better options) 


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Django, React, Python and Golang projects if there are Cybersecurity related it's definetly a plus.

- 📫 How to reach me, send a 🕊️ on  twitter @Mr_vladSystem42.
